# @fractaal/pi-context-window

A portable Pi extension that caps the active model's resolved context window.
Pi still owns reserve tokens, compaction, overflow recovery, and continuation.

Commands:

- `/context-window` shows the current model budget.
- `/context-window 128k` sets the current session override.
- `/context-window default` clears the session override.
- `/context-window-default 128k` sets the current model's global default.
- `/context-window-default default` clears that global default.

The session override is persisted in the Pi JSONL. Global defaults are stored
in the same profile directory as `models.json`, using an atomic local JSON file.

## Install and embed

```bash
pi install npm:@fractaal/pi-context-window
```

The package root exports the compiled extension factory; `/contracts` exports the public contracts. Pi discovers the shipped TypeScript entry through `pi.extensions`. These entrypoints and persisted state formats are unchanged by the repository move.

## Development and releases

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:installed` from the monorepo root. The shared Node tests and isolated installed-package acceptance live in `packages/goal-x/tests` and are included in those commands.

Use the [shared release guide](https://github.com/fractaal/pi-extensions/blob/main/docs/releasing.md) and tag `context-window-v<version>`. This package has its own version and npm Trusted Publisher, even when released in a batch with its siblings.

Version 0.1.1 imports the unchanged runtime of 0.1.0 from `fractaal/pi-goal-x@f74698d6a0eb9f78ff80e7adb01c6a9070010804`, without private Git history. The original MIT license is retained.
